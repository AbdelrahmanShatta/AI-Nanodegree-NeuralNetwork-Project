# AI-Nanodegree-Python-Project
Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, i  first had develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch scoring over 90% accuracy , then convert it into a command line application.

### Notes
-the dataset i used on this model is the 102 Category Flower Dataset , you can get it [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) 


-before using predict.py you must run train.py to get the model checkpoint saved, dont worry i froze the initial layers of the model so training the model goes from 6hrs to 5mins
